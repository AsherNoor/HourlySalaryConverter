# HourlySalaryConverter
A simple program to converts Hourly and Salary wages so that you can easily calculate it if you need it.

The reason I created this little program.
When I was job hunting years ago, I knew I needed to earn a certin ammount of money to be able to pay my bills. 
During my hunting, I would come across posts that would either only post the annual Salary or just the Hourly rate.
I needed a quick way to convert the Hourly rate to Salary and vice versa, so that I can be more informed if that payment would work for me.
Once I found the 2 converstion formulas online, it helped me solve that issue, but I was still doing it manually, so I needed a quicker way to do it.
So I wrote this little script, and actually placed a copy of it on my phone, and would run it when ever I needed if I wasn't near my computer.

I'm sure some improvements will be needed, but as a quick tool, it was very helpful for me during that time.
Hopefully it would be helpful to you as well.
